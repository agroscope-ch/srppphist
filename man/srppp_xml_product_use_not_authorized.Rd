\title{Check if a product name indicates that its use is not authorized at the time}
\usage{
srppp_xml_product_use_not_authorized(names, year, exhaustionDeadline)
}
\arguments{
\item{names}{Character vector of product names that should be checked}

\item{year}{The publication years}

\item{exhaustionDeadline}{The exhaustion deadlines}
}
\value{
Boolean (Does a comment in the name indicate that the use of the
product was not authorized at the time of publication of the file?)
}
\description{
In most cases, products are not present in the XML file,
if the "exhaustionDeadline" (German "Aufbrauchsfrist"), i.e. the date until
stocks of the product can still be rightully used is earlier than the date
of the publication.
}
\details{
However, in some cases, comments are amended to the product name that show
that they are not authorized. This is especially true for the year 2011,
where a number of products contain comments such as
\itemize{
\item (Bew. suspendiert/Aut. suspendue/Aut. sospesa)
\item (Bew. beendet/Aut. révoquée/Aut. revocata)
}

If such a comment is detected, the function returns TRUE.

Other comments indicate that authorisation to use the product is not clarified,
such as
\itemize{
\item [Bewilligung beendet: Wegen hängigem Gerichtsverfahren gilt einstweilen folgende Aufbrauchfrist: 31.05.2022. Verkauf ist einstweilen weiterhin möglich.]
}

In all but one of these cases, the date of the exhaustion deadline in the comment is
later than the date of the publication, therefore the function returns
FALSE. In the specific case of the product Allegro (W-5479) in the year 2022,
the exhaustion deadline given in the comment is before the publication of the
register. However, in that case the exhaustionDeadline in the dedicated
field is 31 August 2022, so it is assumed the use of the product was
authorized at least in a part of 2022.

Comments indicating that an authorization renewal is still in process are
not considered to indicate that the use was not authorized at the time
of publication. Examples for such comments are
\itemize{
\item [Erneuerungsgesuch in Bearbeitung]
\item (demande de renouvellement en cours)
}

Such comments are frequently found in the registers published in 2016 and 2017,
but also occur in later years.

Finally, in the register for 2020 there are a number of products where an
exhaustion date of 31 December 2019 is indicated in the comment, and in the
register for 2022, there are two products where an exhaustion date of
31 December 2021 is indicated. In these cases, the function returns TRUE.
