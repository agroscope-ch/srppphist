The following table shows the names under which products with different 
active ingredient combinations were registered between 2011 and 2025 in the
Swiss Register of Plant Protection Products.

In most cases, simply a different active ingredient name was chosen for the same
active ingredient. For example, a content of propamocarb-hydrochlorid 
was later given in terms of the cation propamocarb, and a content of 
tribenuron-methyl was later expressed in terms of the corresponding acid
tribenuron. In  other cases, banned substances like carbendazim were replaced 
by alternative active substances. Sometimes, a complete set of active ingredients
was apparently replaced by a different set of active ingredients. In the case
of the product name "Dominator", three very different active ingredient compositions
were registered under this name.
