    shortDescription: srppphist is an R package containing historical data from the
      Swiss Register of Plant Protection Products
    longDescription: Data objects extracted from historical XML versions of the
      Swiss Register of Plant Protection Products ‘SRPPP’. Starting from 2011,
      one such data object is contained for each year. Note that the
      information contained in this project is outdated. An online version of
      the current register can be accessed via
      https://www.psm.admin.ch/de/produkte. An XML dump of the current register
      can be read in using the companion package agroscope-ch/srppp. There is
      no guarantee of correspondence of the data contained in or read in using
      this package with any online version, or with the original registration
      documents. Also, the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office,
      coordinating the authorisation of plant protection products in
      Switzerland, does not answer requests regarding this package.
