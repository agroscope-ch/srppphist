Description: Data objects extracted from historical XML versions of the Swiss
  Register of Plant Protection Products 'SRPPP'. Starting from 2011, one such
  data object is contained for each year. Note that the information contained
  in this project is outdated. An online version of the current register can be
  accessed via <https://www.psm.admin.ch/de/produkte>. An XML dump of the
  current register can be read in using the 'srppp' package. There is no
  guarantee of correspondence of the data contained in or read in using this 
  package with any online version, or with the original registration documents.  
  Also, the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office, coordinating the 
  authorisation of plant protection products in Switzerland, does not answer 
  requests regarding this package.
