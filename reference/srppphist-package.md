# srppphist: Historical Data from the Swiss Register of Plant Protection Products as an R Package

Data objects extracted from historical XML versions of the Swiss
Register of Plant Protection Products 'SRPPP'. Starting from 2011, one
such data object is contained for each year. Note that the information
contained in this project is outdated. An online version of the current
register can be accessed via <https://www.psm.admin.ch/de/produkte>. An
XML dump of the current register can be read in using the 'srppp'
package. There is no guarantee of correspondence of the data contained
in or read in using this package with any online version, or with the
original registration documents. Also, the Federal Food Safety and
Veterinary Office, coordinating the authorisation of plant protection
products in Switzerland, does not answer requests regarding this
package.
